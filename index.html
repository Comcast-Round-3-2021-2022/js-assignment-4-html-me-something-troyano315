         <p>Crypto-mining doesn't involve picks and shovels. It refers to the process of verifying transactions on the blockhain using computer hardwre to sovle mathematical hash functions. A decade ago it was a niche hobby for a handful of enthusiasts overclocking homebrewed-rigs in pursuit of a better world. Today its a global industry, complete with specialized equipment and dozens of stakeholders, from semiconductor manufacturers all the way to regional utilities and nation states.</p>

         <p>ASIC Miner An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner is a computerized device or hardware that uses ASICs for the sole purpose of mining bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. In general, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is optimized to compute just a single function or set of related functions.</p>

         <p> A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is responsible for the digital rendering in a computer system. Due to a GPU's power potential vs. a CPU, or central processing unit, they have become more useful in blockchain mining due to their speed and efficiency.</p>
