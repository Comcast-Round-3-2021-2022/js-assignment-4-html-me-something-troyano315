         <h2>What is Crypto Mining?</h2>
         <img src="" alt="Blockchain Network Image"style="width:1200px;height:600px;">
         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Crypto-mining doesn't involve picks and shovels. It refers to the process of verifying transactions on the blockhain using computer hardwre to sovle mathematical hash functions. A decade ago it was a niche hobby for a handful of enthusiasts overclocking homebrewed-rigs in pursuit of a better world. Today its a global industry, complete with specialized equipment and dozens of stakeholders, from semiconductor manufacturers all the way to regional utilities and nation states.</p>
         <p> Mining is one of the key elements that allows Bitcoin to regulate the distributed network of computers that helps make its software possible. By racing to complete cryptographic puzzles, miners propose the blocks that make up the Bitcoin blockchain and that house the history of network transactions. When a block is discovered by a miner, they announce that block to the network where it is verified and approved by other nodes. In exchange for this service, new Bitcoins are sent to the winning miners. The mechanism that keeps this process in sync is called Proof of Work (PoW), and it does so by mandating that miners expend computational energy to add blocks to the blockchain. While many will use the energy consumption as a knock against Bitcoin, it is important to note that many financial-related activities consume significantly more energy than Bitcoin mining, including gold mining and cash production. To solve the cryptographic puzzles and find valid blocks, miners must uncover the right string of pseudorandom numbers, called a hash, which must match conditions set out by the protocol. Essentially, it is a lottery system where miners' odds of finding new blocks increase depending on how much energy they expend. Hashing is a mathematical operation that takes in any arbitrary quantity of data and produces a fixed size output. To propose blocks in the Bitcoin protocol, computers race to generate hashes until one of the hashes has a small enough value. The winning hash is then broadcasted to other computers for them to verify whether the solution is true or not. If it is valid, the user who broadcasted the block is awarded new Bitcoin.</p><p>(Credit, Kraken Intelligence)</p>

            <h2 id="mainHeading">Can you legally mine crypto?</h2>
            <img src="/Users/hjohns204/Assignment4/js-assignment-4-html-me-something-troyano315/images/302-3028991_incognito-icon-fedora-incognito-clipart-hd-png-download.png" alt="Shady Dude"style="width:400px;height:400px;">
            <p>If you are wondering whether bitcoin mining is legal, the answer is yes in most cases. There are a few countries where bitcoin mining is outlawed, such as Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar and Tunisia, according to TheStreet, reporting on a November 2021 Law Library of Congress report</p>

         <p>There two most common examples examples of crypto miners are ASIC an GPU miners.</p>

         <p>ASIC Miner An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner is a computerized device or hardware that uses ASICs for the sole purpose of mining bitcoin or another cryptocurrency. In general, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is optimized to compute just a single function or set of related functions.</p>
         <p> A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is responsible for the digital rendering in a computer system. Due to a GPU's power potential vs. a CPU, or central processing unit, they have become more useful in blockchain mining due to their speed and efficiency.</p>

         <h2>Can I mine NFTs? &lt;</h2>
         <img src="/Users/hjohns204/Assignment4/js-assignment-4-html-me-something-troyano315/images/MoonCatNFT.jpg" alt="catnft">
         <p>No, lol</p>
         <p>While you cannot mine NFTs directly, mining supports the NFT ecosystem indirectly by helping run and secure the blockchain network.</p>

         <h2>How do I mine?</h2>
         <p>Well, first you should decide what type of crypto mining you want to do.</p>
         <p> There are many ways to mine crypto:            
            <li>Mining pools: Groups of miners who work together to mine crypto and share block rewards. Miners pay a small percentage of those block rewards as a pool fee.</li>
            <li>Solo mining: Mining on your own. It's much harder to earn block rewards this way, so mining pools are often the better choice.</li>
            <li>Cloud mining: Paying a company to mine crypto on your behalf with its own mining devices. Cloud mining requires a contract, and the terms almost always favor the company and not the miner.</li>

         <h2>What else do I need?</h2>
         <p>First select a crypto that you are interested in, for example Ethereum and follow the steps below:
            <li>Buy your mining Equipment</li>
            <li>Setup a crypto wallet</li>
            <li>configure your mining device</li>
            <li>Join a pool!!</li>
